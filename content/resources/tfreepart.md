description: Part of a tutorial which describes how, given an initial wave function,
  the wave function at time t can be found. First the initial wave function is decomposed
  into an expansion of the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions. Time dependence is then applied
  to these eigenfunctions. Finally, the wave function in x-space is recreated from
  the expansion.
